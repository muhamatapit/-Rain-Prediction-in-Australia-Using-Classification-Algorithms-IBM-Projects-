# -Rain-Prediction-in-Australia-Using-Classification-Algorithms-IBM-Projects-
In fulfillment of the Honors component within the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera, a classifier was developed to forecast the occurrence of rainfall on the subsequent day. 

The dataset utilized for this project was sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. Extensive data cleaning procedures were applied to ensure the data's quality and integrity. Subsequently, a range of classification algorithms were employed to construct predictive models using the training dataset. 

Evaluation of model performance was conducted using a variety of metrics on the testing dataset to ascertain effectiveness and reliability.

Used these algorithms:
  1. Linear Regression
  1. KNN
  1. Decision Trees
  1. Logistic Regression
  1. SVM


Evaluated the models using:
  1. Accuracy Score
  1. Jaccard Index
  1. F1-Score
  1. LogLoss
  1. Mean Absolute Error
  1. Mean Squared Error
  1. R2-Score
